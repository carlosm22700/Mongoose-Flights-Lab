## Intro
Today in the Intro to Mongoose lesson you Created and Read documents using a Movie Model.

In this lab, you'll do the same, except you'll create and use a Flight model.

You'll begin by creating a mongoose-flights project.

FYI, future lessons will expand upon the mongoose-movies project, and the labs will expand upon the mongoose-flights project!

The final version of mongoose-flights (parts 1 thru 3 combined) will be a deliverable, so do each part and don't fall behind.
